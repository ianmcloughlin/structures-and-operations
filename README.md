# Structures and Operations
These notes were created by [Ian McLoughlin](https://ianmcloughlin.github.io).

#### Compilation
The notes are written in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), and a [TeX distribution](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) is required to compile them.
The LaTeX package [minted](https://github.com/gpoore/minted) is also required.
They can then be compiled with:
```bash
$ latexmk
```
